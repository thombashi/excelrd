Loading worksheets on demand
=============================

.. currentmodule:: excelrd.book

This feature, new in version 0.7.1, is governed by the ``on_demand`` argument
to the :func:`~excelrd.open_workbook` function and allows saving memory and time by
loading only those sheets that the caller is interested in, and releasing sheets
when no longer required.

``on_demand=False`` (default):
  No change. :func:`~excelrd.open_workbook` loads global data
  and all sheets, releases resources no longer required (principally the
  :class:`str` or :class:`mmap.mmap` object containing the Workbook stream),
  and returns.

``on_demand=True`` and BIFF version < 5.0:
  A warning message is emitted,
  ``on_demand`` is recorded as ``False``, and the old process is followed.

``on_demand=True`` and BIFF version >= 5.0:
  :func:`~excelrd.open_workbook` loads global
  data and returns without releasing resources. At this stage, the only
  information available about sheets is :attr:`Book.nsheets` and
  :meth:`Book.sheet_names`.

:meth:`Book.sheet_by_name` and :meth:`Book.sheet_by_index` will load the
requested sheet if it is not already loaded.

:meth:`Book.sheets` will load all unloaded sheets.

The caller may save memory by calling
:meth:`Book.unload_sheet` when finished with the sheet.
This applies irrespective of the state of ``on_demand``.

The caller may re-load an unloaded sheet by calling :meth:`Book.sheet_by_name`
or :meth:`Book.sheet_by_index`, except if the required resources have been
released (which will
have happened automatically when ``on_demand`` is false). This is the only
case where an exception will be raised.

The caller may query the state of a sheet using :meth:`Book.sheet_loaded`.

:meth:`Book.release_resources` may used to save memory and close
any memory-mapped file before proceeding to examine already-loaded
sheets. Once resources are released, no further sheets can be loaded.

When using on-demand, it is advisable to ensure that
:meth:`Book.release_resources` is always called, even if an exception
is raised in your own code; otherwise if the input file has been
memory-mapped, the :class:`mmap.mmap` object will not be closed and you will
not be able to access the physical file until your Python process
terminates. This can be done by calling :meth:`Book.release_resources`
explicitly in the finally part of a try/finally block.

The Book object is also a context manager, so  you can wrap your code in a
``with`` statement that will make sure underlying resources are closed.
